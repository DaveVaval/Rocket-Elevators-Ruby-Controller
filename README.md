## Rocket Elevators Ruby Controller

Welcome to the Ruby controller for Rocket Elevators! 

- Ruby is a really interesting language. None the less, I am really proud to have learned it's little quriks!


An instance of column is created and when a en elevator is called, the column will send the best elevator to the user based on the different attributes of the elevators and the origin of the request.

In order to see it in action, paste one of these scenarios at the bottom of the script and run it in your terminal:

```
Scenario1() , Scenario2() , Scenario3()
```
